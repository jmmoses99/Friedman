Description: This package provides additional functions for data analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
         and intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs).
         It includes utilities for batch processing, data validation, 
         sequence cleaning, and integration with the 'idpr' package.
         Parallel processing is supported via the BiocParallel framework to
         efficiently handle large proteome-scale data sets.
