Blog IDPsBio R package: https://jmmoses99-drjac.wordpress.com/2025/11/30/week-14-idpsbio-r-package/
Need to install Biostrings and idpr. I import idpr, BiocParallel, and openxlsx.
This package provides additional functions for data analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
         and intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs). It works on Windows and macOs systems.
         It includes utilities for batch processing, data validation, 
         sequence cleaning, and integration with the 'idpr' package.
         Parallel processing is supported via the BiocParallel framework to
         efficiently handle large proteome-scale data sets.

 Tests can be found in tests/testthat folders.
