\title{Clean protein sequences and accessions for IDPR processing}
\usage{
clean_sequences_and_accessions(sequences, accessions, warn = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{A character vector of protein sequences.}

\item{accessions}{A character vector of protein accessions (names of sequences or explicit vector).}

\item{warn}{Logical; if TRUE, prints warnings for sequences where invalid residues were removed.}
}
\value{
A list with cleaned sequences and accessions:
\item{sequences}{Character vector of cleaned protein sequences.}
\item{accessions}{Character vector of cleaned UniProt accessions.}
}
\description{
This function prepares real-world protein data for the \code{idpr} package.
It ensures that sequences contain only valid amino acids (A, R, N, D, C, E, Q, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, V)
and converts them to uppercase. It also normalizes UniProt-style accessions from
"sp|P04637|P53_HUMAN" → "P04637".
}
\examples{
raw_seq <- c("sp|P04637|P53_HUMAN" = "MKQTALV123$")
cleaned <- clean_sequences_and_accessions(names(raw_seq), raw_seq)
cleaned$sequences
cleaned$accessions
}
